\section{Introduction}

In 2012, scientits have confirmed a new particle, the Higgs Boson.

The experiment produces a lot of data and we will use machine learning in order to understand the pattern hidden in there.

First of all, we will brefely introduce basic concepts of machine learning to find solutions to problems. Then, we will explore the data to see how to improve results by cleaning the inputs. Eventually, we will how to validate the solutions.
